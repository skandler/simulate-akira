Hi friends

Whatever who you are and what your title is if you' re reading this it means the internal infrastructure of your
company is fully or partially dead, all your backups - virtual, physical - everything that we managed to reach -
are completely removed. Moreover, we have taken a great amount of your corporate data prior to encryption

Well, for now let's keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue. We're
fully aware of what damage we caused by locking your internal sources. At the moment. you have to know:

1. Dealing with us you will save A LOT due to we are not interested in ruining your financially. We will study in
depth your finance, bank

income statements, your savings, investments etc. and present our reasonable demand to you. If you have an active
cyber insurance, let us know and we will guide you how to properly use it. Also, dragging out the negotiation
process will lead to failing of a deal

2. Paying us you save your TIME, MONEY, EFFORTS and be back on track within 24 hours approximately. Our decryptor
works properly on any files or systems, so you will be able to check it by requesting a test decryption service
from the beginning of our conversation. [f you decide to recover on your own, keep in mind that you can
permanently lose access to some files or accidently corrupt them — in this case we won't be able to help.

3. The security report or the exclusive first-hand information that you will receive upon reaching an agreement is
of a great value, since NO full audit of your network will show you the vulnerabilities that we' ve managed to
detect and used in order to get into. identify backup solutions and upload your data.|

4. As for your data, if we fail to agree, we will try to sell personal information/trade secrets/databases/source
codes — generally speaking, everything that has a value on the darkmarket - to multiple threat actors at ones.
Then all of this will be published in our blog -

5. We're more than negotiable and will definitely find the way to settle this quickly and reach an agreement which
will satisfy both of us
